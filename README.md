## Linestar Scrape

### Goals
**The goal of this project is to provide a person with a standardized format for getting linestar ownership data so that it can be used for better understanding daily fantasy competitions**

Example:
https://www.linestarapp.com/Ownership/Sport/NBA/Site/FanDuel/PID/420

In order to scrape this page, lots of tedious work would have to be done in order to pull data from this site that could only be used for a specific use case. Why not make a package that can be used by everyone? This page contains valueable information to fantasy players and can be used for many DFS data science applications.

### Installation
`pip install linestar-scrape`
* Be sure to update often to get the latest mapping from human datetime to linestar date id

### Methods
`fanduel_nba_own_date(date)`

Inputs:
* Python datetime

Output: Linestar Page Data Object containing Linestar Data For That Date

`fanduel_nba_own_date_range(date1, date2)`

Inputs:
* date1 = Python datetime for first date
* date2 = Python datetime for second date

Output: Linestar Map with Date String (YYYY-MM-DD) being the key and a Linestar Page Data Object being a value
